# Basic-Portfolio
## Main Objective :
Create 3 pages 
* index.html 
* contact.html  
* portfolio.html

#### Index.html      - This is the page where I display things like my picture and some Bio information.

#### Contact.html    - In here I created I text area where you can send me a message that has a link to my email.

#### Portfolio.html  - This page will display all my work and projects.U can find images with the project name and has a link                        to my github repo deploy version of the project, all you have to do is click on it.


All pages have the same "skeleton" which means the nav bar and my personal links to indeed , github , and stackover flow.
You can navigate easily from page to page by using the nav bar menu of the 3 pages.

Here is a picure as example  of the finish project:
